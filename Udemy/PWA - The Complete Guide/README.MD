# Progressive Web Apps - Complete Guide

This source code is part of Maximilian Schwarzmüller's "Progressive Web Apps - Complete Guide" course on udemy.com.

## How to Use

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine. Simply download the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and go through the installation steps.

Once Node.js is installed, open your command prompt or terminal and **navigate into this project folder**. There, run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.

Finally, run `npm start` to start the development server and visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the running application.
