Controlling the Node.js Process

    Want to quit your running Node.js server?

    You can always do that by pressing CTRL + C in the terminal/ command prompt window where you started your server
    (i.e. where you ran node app.js).

Request & Response Headers

    On both requests and responses, Http headers are added to transport metadata from A to B.

    The following article provides a great overview of available headers and their role:
       https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers

    Whilst this article is a great resource, especially to dive deeper, please don't learn this list by heart though!
    You'll encounter many of these headers throughout the course and I'll explain them when we need them.
