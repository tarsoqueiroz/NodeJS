* ZooKeeper

ZooKeeper is a distributed co-ordination service to manage large set of hosts. 
Co-ordinating and managing a service in a distributed environment is a complicated 
process.

ZooKeeper solves this issue with its simple architecture and API. ZooKeeper allows 
developers to focus on core application logic without worrying about the distributed 
nature of the application.
